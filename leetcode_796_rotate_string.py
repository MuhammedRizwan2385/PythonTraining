'''Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
Output: true'''
